All javascript variables must be identified with unique names.

The unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like `x` or `y`) or more descriptive names (`age`, `sum`, `totalVolume`). 

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
- Names can cotain leters, digits, underscoresm and dollar signs.
- Names must begin with a letter.
- Names are case sensitive (`y` and `Y` are different variables)
- Reserved words (Javascript Keywords) can't be used as names.
